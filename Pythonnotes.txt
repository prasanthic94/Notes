->going through the video introduction to python:

Python is a programming language, and interpreted object-oriented and high-level language.
It also supports procedural read programming as well as object-oriented.

->going through the video in string

->code will be uploaded in the ipython

what is the difference between a method and function?
Functions or methods basically the same	thing.
A method is a just a function that belongs to an object.

->going through the video in string

->going through the video in Integers and Floats - Working with Numeric Data

Integer is a whole number and a float as a decimal

->going through the video in Variables & Data Types

Variables its basically just a container where we can store certain data values, different type of a data we can store inside of variables

-> going through video in getting input from user
code will be uploaded in the ipython
-> going through video in lists,tuples, and sets
code will be uploaded in the ipython

-> going through video in - Dictionaries 
Dictionaries: Dictionaries is a pair of value, we can declare the values in key and values.
If we want to create a dictionaries we need to open the curly basis
practice Code will be uploaded in the ipython
adding and removing the dictionaries from dictionaries
How to copy dictonaries from one variable to another variable
code will be uploaded in the ipython

Conditionals and Booleans:
Going through video

Boolean represents true or false value.
conditional statement are used to decide whether code has to be execute or skip based on the evaluation of the condition.
practice Code will be uploaded in the ipython

Loops and Iterations:
going through video
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence
with the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items
with the continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next.

Functions:
Going through video:
sets of instruction
Functions are basically some instructions packaged together that perform a specific task
In python a function is defined using the def keyword.

Import modules:
Going through video
module is a collection of functions.
module is .py extension will be there.
we write a code in module we can reuse it that code, that file we can import and use that
In modules we have classes, functions, and variables will be there
if we want to import file we use Import Modulename (here import is a keyword and name of your module)
